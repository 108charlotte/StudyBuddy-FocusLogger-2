CHATGPT created the basic python starter template for app.py, along with some boilerplate html for my layout.html file

I often consulted the FLASK DOCUMENTATION, and used a code snippet from it along with instructions to create a static folder and name the icon favicon.ico in order to add an icon to my webpage. I also consulted the flask documentation to implement jinja and create a layout.html

I used a Medium article by MOSIN INAMDAR titled "How to make a Signup, Login, and logout Route in flask app in 5 minutes" in order to model my login/registration system. I actually ended up using this article's structure for the backend too

I then used a tutorial from CodeShack titled "Login System with Python Flask and MySQL" in order to create the backend. I ended up deleting all MySQL code so ultimately did not use this article. 

COPILOT created the venv environment and gave me step-by-step instructions on how to set it up. I also used its step-by-step instructions on connecting MySQL to vs code. 

Used COPILOT and FLASK DOCUMENTATION on flashed messages in order to add message flashing to this application (here is the link to this specific article: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/patterns/flashing/)

Used a Medium article by Akanni Modupe Adegoke titled "Securing Your Flask Application: Hashing Passwords Tutorial" in order to alter my password hashing system from the other medium article since I was getting an error. Databases also created using code snippet altered from medium article. 

Used code from sitepoint article by Yemi Ojedapo titled "How to Perform User Authentication with Flask-Login" to finish creating the registration system. 

I used chatgpt extensively to transition my code from the flask framework to a django one. 

The tasks application is from harvard's CS50W lecture 3 on django

In order to create a user authentication system I used a Tech With Tim tutorial titled "Django Tutorial - Login, Logout and User Authentication"
